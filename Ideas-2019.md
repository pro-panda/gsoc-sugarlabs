# GSoC 2019 Ideas:
This is the list of potential projects we've planned for this GSoC.  If you have any ideas which can be useful to us, but are not in the list, we'd love to hear from you. You need not be a potential student or a mentor to suggest ideas.

## Criteria for new ideas:
1. Does it fill an empty pedagogy niche in the activity set for Sugar or Sugarizer,
2. Does it increase quality of our software products (Sugar, activities, Music Blocks, Sugarizer),
3. Does it _not_ involve any project infrastructure, e.g. not another app store, web site, or developer landing page,
4. Do we have a developer _now_ who would be willing and able to do it if a student was not available, and who can _promise_ to do it if a student is not selected.

For each project, there is a list of 'Suggested issues to work on'. These issues will help you to get familiar with the project. The more you work on these issues, the more experienced you will be for the project. However, this is not a strict list. You can (read _should_) try and explore other issues as well ;-)

## Port Sugar and core activities to Python 3
**Priority:** High

**Prerequisites**<br>
 - Experience with porting telepathy bindings
 - Strong experience of working on [Sugar](https://www.github.com/sugarlabs/sugar) and activities

**Desciption**<br>
Sugar runs on Python 2. Support for Python 2 is being withdrawn fast and we need to move to Python 3. The work was started in GSoC 2018, see [link](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Python_2to3), and needs to be wrapped up. See GitHub Project [Port to Python 3 via six](https://github.com/orgs/sugarlabs/projects/1) for open issues and pull requests

The telepathy library does not have its bindings for Python 3, and porting Telepathy to its PyGObject binding is a pre requisite for the Port to Python 3 Project, see GitHub Project [Port to TelepathyGLib](https://github.com/orgs/sugarlabs/projects/4).

**Suggested issues to work on:**<br>
 - Sugar-Toolkit-gtk3: [#402 Port to TelepathyGLib](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-toolkit-gtk3/issues/402)
 - Collabwrapper: [#1 Port to TelepathyGLib](https://github.com/sugarlabs/collabwrapper/issues/1)
 - Sugar: [#815 activitychooser window is not modal and adds dependency of toolkit to jarabe](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar/issues/815)
 - Sugar: Completing [#740 Add corner layout](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar/pull/740)
 - gwebsockets: [#2 Release v0.5](https://github.com/sugarlabs/gwebsockets/issues)

## Improve and maintain 20 Sugar activities
**Priority:** Medium

**Prerequisites**<br>
 - Strong experience of working on Sugar activities
 - Releasing and maintaining activities on ASLO

**Description**<br>
Sugar has a lot of activities (250+ on GitHub, and more elsewhere). These activities have a scope for improvement; bugs, features, possible ASLO release required. This project will involve working on atleast 20 activities to improve them. Students can choose activities on their own, and are encouraged to select activities which are either a part of Fructose or have a strong pedagogical value. To understand how to locate and work on activities, see our guide to [Modifying Activities](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-docs/blob/master/src/contributing.md#modifying-activities)

In the proposal, students should mention all the issues they will work on. Any new feature suggestion should be discussed on GitHub Issues in advance.

Since there are a lot of activities to work on, more than 1 instance of this project can be selected

**Suggested Issues to work on:**<br>
 - write-activity: [#28 Port to sugar3.speech](https://github.com/sugarlabs/write-activity/issues/28)
 - jukebox-activity: [#22 Add collaboration for sharing playlist items](https://github.com/sugarlabs/jukebox-activity/issues/22)
 - jukebox-activity: [#23 Enable visualisations in the playbin element for audio content](https://github.com/sugarlabs/jukebox-activity/issues/23)
 - log-activity: [#12 Delete Log File button leaves entry in list](https://github.com/sugarlabs/log-activity/issues/12)
 - read-activity: [#28 add back EPUB support](https://github.com/sugarlabs/read-activity/issues/28)
 - infoslicer: [#23 Traceback, motion_notify](https://github.com/sugarlabs/infoslicer/issues/23)
 - getiabooks: [#6 Ctrl q Ignored](https://github.com/sugarlabs/getiabooks/issues/6)
 - iq-activity: [#10 Port to Latest Sugargame](https://github.com/sugarlabs/iq-activity/issues/10)
 - sin-dientes-activity: [#1 Port to GTK+ 3](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sin-dientes-activity/issues/1)
 - readextexts: [#10 Missing Stop button and continually widening canvas](https://github.com/sugarlabs/readetexts/issues/10)

Suggesting or adding features, fixing bugs, or releasing activities will help you to gain experience

## Port Scratch 3.0 to Sugar Desktop and Fix sugar-web

**Priority:** High

**Prerequisites**<br>
 - Python, GTK, JavaScript knowledge
 - Strong experience of working on Sugar and activities

**Description**<br>
Scratch is a programming environment for kids. The goal of this project is to make bring back the Scratch activity to the Sugar Desktop. Scratch 3.0 was created with HTML 5 using [Googleâ€™s blocky](https://developers.google.com/blockly/). Port scratch 3.0 as a Sugar activity using [Method1](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-docs/blob/master/src/web-activity.md), a web activity that can run on the Sugar Desktop. Fix Sugar-web as it was broken due to certain reasons. The project involves starting off with working on how to build scratch using the details in the link below and also refer to the latest version of [Scratch 3.0](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-gui):
