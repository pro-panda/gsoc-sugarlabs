While deciding on the 'list of activities' for SugarLabs as a part of GSoC 2019, the one thing I found 
myself doing repeatedly was- 'Googling for a globally accepted primary school curriculum'. I also had a discussion with our mentors  via Sugar-devel-mailing list regarding the curriculum.
Therefore ,as suggested by our esteemed mentor @James Cameron, I have put together a Science and a Mathematics curriculum . The curriculum I have put forward is a part the Cambridge International School’s Primary School Curriculum Framework.
I think having a well-defined and well-structured curriculum will be helpful in deciding upon and
creating activities for both, Sugar and Sugarizer as of now and in coming future.
