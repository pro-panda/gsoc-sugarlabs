## Want to work with us ?
We have a lot of interesting project ideas for you. There is
Sugar OS, Sugar Activities, Music Blocks and Sugarizer. You
can start by going through them and see what would you like
to work on.<br>
After that, you can go through our [Ideas](Ideas-2019.md) page
to see our proposed ideas. We would love to hear your own ideas
as well.

You should familiarise yourself with our code, by reporting and
fixing bugs. This will assure us that you will be able to work
on the project ;-)

Before you start writing your proposal, go through our [Proposal
Template](Template.md).

## Community etiquette
Everyone in the community has to be polite and respectful, and
consider everyone else a member of a team and not a competitor.

One should be considerate to everyone else's time. We would like
to have quality discussions, and not answer questions that are
already documented, or available on stackoverflow. This doesn't
mean you can't ask questions, but a clueless user and a lazy
developer are two different things.

While contributing be sure to read the [Contributing](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-docs/blob/master/src/contributing.md) document. If you want to work on an issue, no need to ask for permission. Just make a pull request to fix the issue. 

Tell things as you see them. Be polite, but don't sugar coat it.
You don't have to apologize everytime you make a mistake; but
avoid repeating it again ;-)

Conduct](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-docs/blob/master/src/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
